      <p>Thanks to the easy availability of <a href="http://dfr.jstor.org">counts of words occurring in JSTOR articles</a>, humanists have grown interested in seeing what they can learn about those articles in the aggregate. How can we analyze this digital archive to learn about large-scale patterns in scholarly fields over the last century or more? Recently, one algorithmic approach to investigating patterns in a big set of documents has received quite a bit of attention in the humanities and social sciences: topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X13000442">this overview article from the sociology journal <em>Poetics</em></a>, <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/">this explanation for &ldquo;English majors,&rdquo;</a> or the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937">original paper about the algorithm</a>).</p>
      
      <p>So: take data from DfR, <a href="http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis">wrangle it a little</a>, feed it to <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu">MALLET</a>, and poof! the algorithm yields a topic model. For example, a model of all the articles from the century-long run of <em>PMLA</em>. <em>So what is that?</em></p>

<h2><a href="demo">Try the demo &rarr;</a></h2>

<p>I embarked on this little visualization side project to help me understand such models a little more clearly. The purpose of my DfR browser is to let users see the ways that a topic model attempts to classify words <em>and</em> documents through patterns of co-occurring words. My wish, as a literary scholar, was to interpret the classification of documents—and time-slices of corpora—into topics. But I am wary of the complexity of the overlapping, fuzzy classifications. This visualizer tries to put all the moving pieces of a model into the visual field: topics, documents, words, and (key to interpretation, yet not factored into a simple LDA model) document metadata.</p>

<h2>What this browser shows</h2>

<p>This browser, which I am making public in an <em>alpha release</em>, seeks to reflect the multifaceted nature of a topic model (it is a model of patterns in both <em>words</em> and <em>documents</em>) by offering you multiple views of the model. Navigate among the views by using the navigation links at the top of the screen. </p>

<h3>The overview</h3>

<p>In the <a href="demo/">overview</a>, topics are represented by their most frequent words. There are four different versions of the overview. In any of them, click a topic to go to the view for that topic.

<h4>The grid subview</h4>

<p>In the <a href="demo/#/model/grid">grid view</a>, the topics are arranged in arbitrary order in a grid. Topics are represented by what I like to call Little Circles With Words in Them. The type size reflects a word's weight in a topic. Originally I wanted the circles to be word clouds, but the otherwise impressive <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a> is really not meant to squeeze few words into a very small space (it's much better at a bunch of words in a larger space). So I have opted instead for a simple column of words, with sizes decreasing from the center. <em>Known issue:</em> No effort is made to respect the horizontal bounds of the circle; the number of words is fixed by a parameter, which must be hand-tuned.</p>

<h4>The scaled subview</h4>

<p>In the <a href="demo/#/model/scaled">scaled view</a>, topics are placed close to one another if they are similar (in the sense of: having similar distributions of frequent words). To see overlapping topics more clearly, use the mouse to pan or zoom the view. The measure of topic similarity for the scaled view has to be precalculated. In the demo I use, following <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2160165.2160168">David Mimno</a>, multi-dimensional scaling—i.e., principal coordinates analysis—to reduce the matrix of Jensen-Shannon divergences between topics, considered as distributions over words, into two-dimensional coordinates. The resulting spatial representation does not always produce the most intuitive juxtapositions, but it is sometimes suggestive. I have not done more fine-tuning for this <em>alpha release</em>.</p>

<h4>The list subview</h4>

<p>In the <a href="demo/#/model/list">list view</a>, the topics are listed in table form. To help compare topics among one another, the table can be sorted in several ways. By default topics come in an arbitrary order. Click the "top words" header to see <a href="demo/#/model/list/words">the list sorted alphabetically by most frequent words</a>. On the far right is the proportion of all the words in the corpus assigned to the given topic, visualized as a length (the blue bar). This <a href="demo/#/model/list/frac">sorting by corpus proportion</a> is deceptive in the sense that the highest-proportion topics are often the <em>least</em> interesting parts of the model—agglomerations of very common words without a clear thematic content.</p>

<p>The column to the left of the topic key words shows a miniature graph of the topic time-series (visible more fully in the topic view; see below). This gives a rough sense of the distribution of the topic over document years. Click the column header to sort by the year in which the topic attains its maximum proportion. Note that the y-axes of these miniature bar charts are not all on the same scale.</p>

<h4>The yearly subview</h4>

<p>One wants to have a sense of the shifting composition of the corpus in terms of topics over time. Seeing this as a whole is a challenging visualization problem, and I lack the graphical sense to solve it well. However, d3 offers some options which I am experimenting with. In the <a href="demo/#/model/yearly">yearly subview</a>, all the time series for the topics are stacked on top of one another in a streamgraph (see <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Stack-Layout">the d3 documentation</a>). The height of each topic's stream gives the proportion of the topic in a given year. The topics are reordered by a heuristic for making the visualization less jagged. Colors are used to distinguish topics from one another, but in this <em>alpha release</em> I have given up on trying to come up with a unique color for each topic. The program attempts to stick topic labels in reasonable places, with uneven success. Nonetheless, this view does allow a chance to pick out islands of prominence or topics with unusual spreading over the time space. To take exploration a little further, it is possible to pan and zoom the view (hold down shift while dragging).</p>

<p>Finally, by default the yearly subview stacks up the time series of <em>percentages of the year's words</em> accounted for by a topic. If the corpus has many more words in some years than others, this might be deceptive. So I have left on the option of shifting the yearly view to display <a href="demo/#/model/list/yearly/raw">raw counts of words assigned to topics</a> per year. In the demo here, one immediately notices the oddity of 1952, when <em>PMLA</em> published some extraordinarily long essays.</p>

<h3>The topic view</h3>

<p>This view (see <a href="demo/#/topic/38">an example from the demo, <em>novel story narrative</em></a>) gives a fuller sense of the make-up of a topic. The left column shows the topic as a distribution over words.</p> 

<p>The choice of how to represent the relation of topics and documents is harder. I list the documents where the topic is at its largest proportion (the blue bars visualize this proportion), since these are typically in some sense more &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; of the topic. But pay attention to the size of the proportions as well as the absolute weights, and remember that the document with largest proportion of topic <em>k</em> may nonetheless have an even larger proportion of another topic <em>k&#x0027;</em>.</p>

<p>On the upper right is the tantalizing time-series: the yearly proportion of words in the corpus belonging to the topic. I have chosen bars to emphasize that the model does not assume a smooth evolution from year to year in topics, and neither should we. This does make it harder to see a time trend, however. To focus on prominent documents in the topic <em>for a given year</em>, click a bar on the chart (thus, compare the overall top documents for <a href="demo/#/topic/38"><em>novel story narrative</em></a> with the topic's top documents <a href="demo/#/topic/38/1980">in 1980</a>).
</p>


<h3>The document view</h3>

<p>The document view (see <a href="demo/#/doc/494">an example from the demo, Stallybrass&rsquo;s &ldquo;Against Thinking&rdquo;</a>) simply represents the estimated proportions of the various topics in a given document. It also offers a link which should normally lead to the document on JSTOR itself. These links are via <a href="http://dx.doi.org">dx.doi.org</a>; I use the doi&rsquo;s supplied by DfR in its metadata.</p>

<p><em>Known issue:</em> These links do not always resolve correctly, and I don&rsquo;t understand why. (That example, for instance: the link should lead to <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25501804">this page</a> but doesn&rsquo;t.) Also, if you connect to JSTOR through a web-based proxy, make sure the DOI resolver is not landing you at an unproxied JSTOR page (I use <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> to automatically redirect links to databases through proxies).</p>


<h3>The word view</h3>

<p>The word view&rsquo;s main purpose is to remind us that the topic model tends to divide occurrences of each word among multiple topics (an example from the demo: <a href="demo/#/word/world"><em>world</em></a>).  It displays the top words in each of the topics in which a word is highly ranked; the bars indicate the relative weight <em>within the topic</em> of the words, so that you can see how the focal word compares with the other key words in each topic. Click a word to focus the visualization on that word. Use the text box at the upper right to look up another word in the model.</p>

<p>Again, space limitations mean the browser cannot make use of the full information the model provides about which words in each document have been assigned to which topics.</p>

<h3>The all-words view</h3>

<p>This is a list of the vocabulary of prominent words in any topic (<a href="demo/#/words">demo</a>). Each word links back to the word view. It is not identical with the vocabulary of the topic model, since any word which is not among the top &ldquo;key words&rdquo; supplied to the browser will not be listed. In future I may investigate the feasibility of using the whole topic-word matrix and not just the &ldquo;key words&rdquo;: this matrix could be manageable for relatively restricted vocabularies.</p>

<h3>The bibliography view</h3>

<p>This view focuses on documents (<a href="demo/#/bib">demo</a>). It lists all citations for all the documents included in the model. Because this is typically a lot of documents, I provide rudimentary "faceting": documents are sorted under headings (either letters of the alphabet or decades or years or journals), and you can collapse and expand the panel of document listings under each panel. Use the &ldquo;collapse all&rdquo; button to produce a more tractable display if you know what heading you&rsquo;re interested in; or, if you&rsquo;d like to search on the page, be sure to &ldquo;expand all&rdquo; the panels first so that the browser can see all the citations in the text. The menu gives a few sorting options, of which <a href="demo/#/bib/year/author">year/author</a> and <a href="demo/#/bib/year/journal">year/journal contents</a> are probably most useful.</p>

<p><em>Known issues:</em> the sorting seems to be glitchy for metadata about nineteenth-century articles; the generated citations are imperfectly formatted. Also, this view can take a couple of seconds to load. If I ever work further on this <em>alpha release</em>, I will look for ways to either speed it up or load it incrementally as you scroll.</p>

<p><em>Possible future additions:</em> Eventually, I hope to add some ways to explore the abstract space of documents created by the topic breakdowns, on the model of the scaled topic-space visualization.</p>

<h3>Permalinks</h3>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/kindred-britain-techniques-1-permalinks-graph">this post by Elijah Meeks</a>, I learned how to give each view a permalink, which you can copy from your browser&rsquo;s URL bar. That link takes you directly to the topic, word, document, etc. view you are looking at. For example, the demo&rsquo;s view of the topic arbitrarily numbered 38 (<em>novel story narrative</em>) is at <a href="demo/#/topic/38">agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser/demo/#/topic/38</a>.</p>

<p><em>Technical note:</em> The part of the URL after the <code>#/</code> describes the chosen view into the model. For the implementation, see the <code>view_refresh</code> function in the <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser/blob/master/js/index.js">main source file, index.js</a>. This function is set as the <code>hashchange</code> handler.</p>

<h2>Browsing your own models</h2>

<p>To build your own browser using this code, grab the source on <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser">github</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser">github project page</a> (which is the same as the repository README file) includes more details on how to set up and run dfr-browser with your own topic models, as well as some pointers on how to tune the visualization parameters. I hope to write a more comprehensive tutorial on using my <a href="http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis">dfr-analysis</a> scripts to produce a topic model and visualize it with this browser soon (i.e., sometime in 2013–2014).</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<p>This software is free to use, copy, modify, and distribute under the MIT license (which is to say, please credit me if you do use it). Though it is woefully under-documented, and no doubt bug-ridden and amateurish—which is why this is still an <em>alpha release</em>—perhaps it may be useful to others with similar interests. Please <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser">clone the repository</a> and go to town.
<p>As this is an <em>alpha release</em>, I have not tested this browser beyond my own system, where it appears to work in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. I have relied on <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>, so in principle this should work in recent web browsers on most systems, with the likely exception of Internet Explorer. <em>Known issue:</em> As for touch devices, I don&rsquo;t do too much with hover states, but my design is not quite fully responsive, and I have found problems on small screens. Further development for the <a href="https://twitter.com/goldstoneandrew/status/383297490495475712">iMallet</a> will have to await the work of some other, braver person.</p>

<h2><a name="the-polished-options" class="anchor" href="#the-polished-options"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The polished options</h2>

<p>I looked into other topic-model visualization projects and was impressed by what I found. But I needed a setup which was (1) entirely static, since I didn&rsquo;t have access to a host for dynamic code and (2) tuned to the questions that looking at models of scholarly journals has raised for me. And I found working with <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> to be such a pleasure that I wanted to complete a project in it myself.</p>

<p>Hence this <em>alpha release</em> of something tuned to my own interests and my work on JSTOR&rsquo;s Data for Research data. If you are looking for a more polished general-use model-browsing project, here are some of the options in a burgeoning field:</p>

<p><a href="http://glimmer.rstudio.com/cpsievert/LDAviz/">LDAviz</a>, by Carson Sievert, uses the Shiny R server to support statistically-sophisticated visualizations of both individual topics and the interrelations among topics.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.networkedcorpus.com/">The Networked Corpus</a> is a beautiful way to visualize a topic model of a full-text corpus. </p>

<p>David Mimno&rsquo;s <a href="http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/">jsLDA</a> computes the topic model in the browser as well as visualizing it in interesting ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jgoodwin.net/">Jonathan Goodwin</a>&rsquo;s journal topic-model browsers are very elegant: see e.g. <a href="http://jgoodwin.net/theory-browser/">this one, of literary theory journals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StanfordHCI/termite">Termite</a>, implemented by Jason Chuang and Ashley Jin (paper by <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/termite">Chuang, Manning, and Heer</a>), shows topics and words in visualizations geared toward the crucial task of assessing the quality of a model.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tmve/">Allison Chaney&rsquo;s Topic Model Visualization Engine</a> is a robust static-site generator.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/">The Topic Modeling Tool</a> provides a GUI to make MALLET use easier.</p>
