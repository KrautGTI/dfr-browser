      <p>Thanks to the easy availability of <a href="http://dfr.jstor.org">counts of words occurring in JSTOR articles</a>, humanists have grown interested in seeing what they can learn about those articles in the aggregate. One technique that to apply to such data is topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937">original paper</a>; <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/">explanation for "English majors"</a>). Take data from DfR, <a href="http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis">wrangle it a little</a>, feed it to <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu">MALLET</a>, and poof! the algorithm yields a topic model. For example, a model of all the articles from the century-long run of <em>PMLA</em>. <em>So what is that?</em></p>

<h2><a href="demo">Try the demo &rarr;</a></h2>

<p>I embarked on this little visualization side project to help me understand such models a little more clearly. The purpose of my DfR browser is to let users see the ways that a topic model attempts to classify words <em>and</em> documents through patterns of co-occurring words. My wish, as a literary scholar, was to interpret the classification of documents—and time-slices of corpora—into topics. But I am wary of the complexity of the overlapping, fuzzy classifications. This visualizer tries to put all the moving pieces of a model into the visual field: topics, documents, words, and (key to interpretation, yet not factored into a simple LDA model) document metadata.</p>

<h2>What this browser shows</h2>

<p>This browser, which I am making public in an <em>alpha release</em>, seeks to reflect the multifaceted nature of a topic model (it is a model of patterns in both <em>words</em> and <em>documents</em>) by offering you multiple views of the model. Navigate among the views by using the navigation links at the top of the screen. </p>

<h3>The overview</h3>

<p>In the <a href="demo/">overview</a>, topics are represented by their most frequent words. The overview has three subviews, two graphical (<a href="demo/#/model/grid">Grid</a> and <a href="demo/#/model/scaled">Scaled</a>) and one textual (<a href="demo/#/model/list">List</a>). In any subview, click a topic to go to to the view for that topic.  In the <em>Grid</em>, the topics are arranged in arbitrary order in a grid. In the <em>Scaled</em> view, topics are placed close to one another if they are similar. To see overlapping topics more clearly, use the mouse to pan or zoom the view. The <em>List</em>, which is what it says on the tin, also gives the estimated "hyperparameter" α for each topic. A very small α means the topic likely doesn't account for much of the corpus.</p>

<p>[The measure of similarity is precalculated: following <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2160165.2160168">David Mimno</a>, I have used multi-dimensional scaling—i.e., principal coordinates analysis—to reduce the matrix of Jensen-Shannon divergences between topics, considered as distributions over words, into two-dimensional coordinates. The resulting spatial representation does not always produce the most intuitive juxtapositions, but it is sometimes suggestive. I have not done more fine-tuning for this <em>alpha release</em>.]</p>

<h3>The topic view</h3>

<p>This view (see <a href="demo/#/topic/38">an example from the demo, <em>novel story narrative</em></a>) gives a fuller sense of the make-up of a topic. The left column shows the topic as a distribution of words. On the right is the tantalizing time-series: the yearly proportion of words in the corpus belonging to the topic. I have chosen bars to emphasize that the model does not assume a smooth evolution from year to year in topics, and neither should we.</p>

<p>The choice of how to represent the relation of topics and documents is harder. I list the documents where the topic is at its largest proportion (the blue bars visualize this proportion), since these are typically in some sense more "characteristic" of the topic. But pay attention to the size of the proportions as well as the absolute weights.</p>

<h3>The document view</h3>

<p>The document view (see <a href="demo/#/doc/494">an example from the demo, Stallybrass's "Against Thinking"</a>) simply represents the estimated proportions of the various topics in a given document. It also offers a link which should normally lead to the document on JSTOR itself. These links are via <a href="http://dx.doi.org">dx.doi.org</a>; I use the doi's supplied by DfR in its metadata. These do not always resolve correctly, and I don't understand why. (That example, for instance: the link should lead to <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25501804">this page</a> but doesn't.) If you connect to JSTOR through a web-based proxy, make sure the DOI resolver is not landing you at an unproxied JSTOR page (I use <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> to automatically redirect links to databases through proxies).</p>

<h3>The word view</h3>

<p>The word view's main purpose is to remind us that the topic model tends to divide occurrences of each word among multiple topics (an example from the demo: <a href="http://localhost:4000/demo/#/word/world"><em>world</em></a>).  It lists the topic in which a word is highly ranked, as well as the word's rank within that topic. Use the text box at the upper right to look up another word in the model.</p>

<p>Again, space limitations mean the browser cannot make use of the full information the model provides about which words in each document have been assigned to which topics.</p>

<h3>The all-words view</h3>

<p>This is a list of the vocabulary of prominent words in any topic (<a href="demo/#/words">demo</a>). Each word links back to the word view. It is not identical with the vocabulary of the topic model, since any word which is not among the top "key words" supplied to the browser will not be listed. In future I may investigate the feasibility of using the whole topic-word matrix and not just the "key words": this matrix could be manageable for relatively restricted vocabularies.</p>

<h3>The bibliography view</h3>

<p>This view focuses on documents (<a href="demo/#/bib">demo</a>). It lists all citations for all the documents included in the model. Because this is typically a lot of documents, I provide rudimentary "faceting": documents are sorted under headings (either letters of the alphabet or decades or years or journals), and you can collapse and expand the panel of document listings under each panel. Use the "collapse all" button to produce a more tractable display if you know what heading you're interested in; or, if you'd like to search on the page, be sure to "expand all" the panels first so that the browser can see all the citations in the text. The menu gives a few sorting options.</p>

<p>This view takes a couple of seconds to load, normally. If I ever work further on this <em>alpha release</em> I will look for ways to either speed it up or load it incrementally as you scroll.</p>

<h3>Permalinks</h3>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/kindred-britain-techniques-1-permalinks-graph">wisdom of Elijah Meeks</a>, I learned how to give each view a permalink, which you can copy from your browser's URL bar. That link takes you directly to the topic, word, document, etc. view you are looking at. For example, the demo's view of the topic arbitrarily numbered 38 (<em>novel story narrative</em>) is at <a href="demo/#/topic/38">agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser/demo/#/topic/38</a>. </p>

<h2>Technical information</h2>

<p>Learn more about the underpinnings, and grab the source, on the <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser">GitHub project page</a> for this browser. I looked into other topic-model visualization projects and was impressed by what I found (see <a href="#the-polished-options">The polished options</a> below). But I needed a setup which was (1) entirely static, since I didn't have access to a host for dynamic code and (2) tuned to the questions that looking at models of scholarly journals has raised for me. And I found working with <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> to be such a pleasure that I wanted to complete a project in it myself.</p>

<p>This software is free to use, copy, modify, and distribute under the MIT license (which is to say, please credit me if you do use it). Though it is no doubt bug-ridden and amateurish—which is why this is still an <em>alpha release</em>—perhaps it may be useful to others with similar interests. Please <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser">clone the repository</a> and go to town. The project page gives more detail on how to convert MALLET outputs into the formats needed by this code. I hope to write a tutorial on using my <a href="http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis">dfr-analysis</a> scripts to produce a topic model and visualize it with this browser soon.</p>

<p>As this is an <em>alpha release</em>, I have not tested this browser beyond my own system. I have relied on d3 and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>, so in principle this should work in recent web browsers on any system, with the likely exception of Internet Explorer. As for touch devices, I don't do too much with hover states, and bootstrap is <em>supposed</em> to be responsive out of the box, but further development for the <a href="https://twitter.com/goldstoneandrew/status/383297490495475712">iMallet</a> will have to await some other, braver developer.</p>

<a name="the-polished-options" class="anchor" href="#the-polished-options"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The polished options</h2>

<p>This is an <em>alpha release</em> of something I just hacked together, and it is really tuned to my own interests and my work on JSTOR's Data for Research data. Here are some more polished general-use model-browsing projects:</p>

<p><a href="http://glimmer.rstudio.com/cpsievert/LDAviz/">LDAviz</a>, by Carson Sievert, uses the Shiny R server to support visualizations of both individual topics and the interrelations among topics.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.networkedcorpus.com/">The Networked Corpus</a> is a beautiful way to visualize a topic model of a full-text corpus. </p>

<p>David Mimno's <a href="https://github.com/mimno/jsLDA">jsLDA</a> computes the topic model in the browser as well as visualizing it in interesting ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jgoodwin.net/">Jonathan Goodwin</a>'s journal topic-model browsers are very elegant: see e.g. <a href="http://jgoodwin.net/theory-browser/">this one, of literary theory journals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tmve/">Allison Chaney's Topic Model Visualization Engine</a> is a robust static-site generator.</p>
