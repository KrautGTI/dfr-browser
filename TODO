sidebar with topic model vocabulary:

- topics
- key word
- top document

example narratives

speed up loading (mod_zip rather than jszip?)

fix linking into jstor.

words should also have links to jstor dfr search in signs (for ngrams-like exploration---this needs a note)

uglifyjs into a single versioned file linked in index.html

AM 5/2 questions: 
- get rid of "by journal, then by journal contents" option in bibliography view?
- Signs logo in nav bar?
- Center screenshots
- Is all words the top 50 words for all topics?

5/2 Ideas discussed
- Titles or popovers for key terms
- Enhanced word view
- Default view as list?


BUGS

- 65 topics - does not show up on grid
- jstor id resolution for older items: write JSTOR
- apparent problems with d3 (?) on firefox 30 under MacOS 10.8, unable to replicate on ffx 30 on 10.7.5

FIXED BUGS

- chrome vs firefox vs ... sorting not the same (not stable sort??)

TEXT TO WRITE

1. Introductory text
2. Explanation of the technique
3. How to read (vocabulary)
4. Interpretive narratives (later) and cautions

Tasks:

1. ask others to comment
2. RUCore or other permanent storage
3. indication of journal special issues 
	-Signs editorial intern Tatiana working on a list
4. hand label topics individually, compare to decide on labels


Per 7/28/14 email conversation:

Analyzing the model:

- topic labels
	- Susana, Lindsey, Andy, and Laura (SLAL) - Aug 1

- which are uninformative?
	- SLAL - Aug 1
	-consult with AG after early Aug Skype convo


 Text:

- editorial comments on the model?
	- Early Sept

 - other remaining writing/editing?
	- short analysis of example topics
		-SLA draft Aug 30

Software:

- topic labels
- hiding topics
- article/issue tagging (e.g.: virtual ToCs, indication of special issues...)
- interface refinements, various (e.g.: how the introductory text appears/disappears, whether the site detects incompatible browsers)
- links or other display of editorial comments?
- more appropriate bibliography page sorting options...
- fixing links to articles?
- retooling dates?

 Design:

- where and how to display editorial comments
- match Signs's style more closely? Nothing about the typography, color scheme, etc. of the browser is fixed. I think it would be good to think about distinguishing this a little from the bland default look of bootstrap (and, in fact, from the other model browser site I've made public, www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ag978/quiet).
	-Andy plus others' input
		-initial attempts ~Aug 15

 Other tasks?
- overall site design
	-AM and Susana, Lindsey and Laura
		-sample page mockups and overall structure before Aug 30
- contact Jonathan Goodwin re: republishing his cocitation graph (http://jgoodwin.net/signs/test.html)
	-Andy, 7/29


Agenda for SLAL early Aug Skype meeting
- compare topic labels
- brainstorm overall site design
- ideas for styling model browser
- finalize 10 ToCs
