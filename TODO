sidebar with topic model vocabulary:

- topics

example narratives

speed up loading (mod_zip rather than jszip?)

fix linking into jstor.

words should also have links to jstor dfr search in signs (for ngrams-like exploration---this needs a note)


uglifyjs into a single versioned file linked in index.html

BUGS

- chrome vs firefox vs ... sorting not the same (not stable sort??)
- 65 topics - does not show up on grid
- jstor id resolution for older items: write JSTOR
