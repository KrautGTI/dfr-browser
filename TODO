sidebar with topic model vocabulary:

- topics
- key word
- top document

example narratives

speed up loading (mod_zip rather than jszip?)

fix linking into jstor.

words should also have links to jstor dfr search in signs (for ngrams-like exploration---this needs a note)

uglifyjs into a single versioned file linked in index.html

AM 5/2 questions: 
- get rid of "by journal, then by journal contents" option in bibliography view?
- Signs logo in nav bar?
- Center screenshots
- Is all words the top 50 words for all topics?

5/2 Ideas discussed
- Titles or popovers for key terms
- Enhanced word view
- Default view as list?


BUGS

- 65 topics - does not show up on grid
- jstor id resolution for older items: write JSTOR
- apparent problems with d3 (?) on firefox 30 under MacOS 10.8, unable to replicate on ffx 30 on 10.7.5

FIXED BUGS

- chrome vs firefox vs ... sorting not the same (not stable sort??)
