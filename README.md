# A simple topic-model browser

These files use [d3](http://d3js.org) to provide a way to browse some of a topic model of JSTOR journal articles in a web browser. For more information and usage notes, see the main project page at [agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser](http://agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser). 

This software is free to use, copy, modify, and distribute under the MIT license (which is to say, please credit me if you do use it). This project skews to my needs as a literary scholar and to my amateurishness as a programmer. No aspect of this code has been systematically tested. Sorry.
